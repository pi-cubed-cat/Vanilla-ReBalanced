Vanilla ReBalanced is a content mod that aims to balance existing vanilla content and add new Jokers for the sake of build variety in high stakes.  
Requires [Steamodded 1.0.0-beta-0827c](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta-0827c) or later.
For the best experience, also download the [**Extra Credit**](https://github.com/GuilloryCraft/ExtraCredit) and [**Bunco (jumbocarrot fork)**](https://github.com/jumbocarrot0/Bunco) mods, as Vanilla ReBalanced is designed to utilise some of their additional content.

This mod takes enormous inspiration from the two videos below and aims to manifest as much as possible:
