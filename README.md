Vanilla ReBalanced is a content mod that aims to balance existing vanilla content and add new Jokers for the sake of build variety in high stakes.  
Requires [Steamodded 1.0.0-beta-0827c](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta-0827c) or later.
For the best experience, also download the [**Extra Credit**](https://github.com/GuilloryCraft/ExtraCredit) and [**Bunco (jumbocarrot fork)**](https://github.com/jumbocarrot0/Bunco) mods, as Vanilla ReBalanced is designed to utilise some of their additional content.

This mod takes enormous inspiration from the two videos below and aims to manifest as much as possible:

## Additions
Vanilla ReBalanced initially includes 14 new Jokers, mostly with art and/or abilities lifted from my other mods. Chaos Theory's card art was designed by LumpyTouch, and was intended to be implemented for Balatro but scrapped. Wee Mini and Forgery have new abilities based on some ideas presented in BU's video. In addition, the mod includes a new edition and a related tag, intended to be a new method of obtaining Tarot cards.  
With Extra Credit and Bunco as intended, Vanilla ReBalanced also includes 35 new Jokers and 3 new decks from Extra Credit, and 11 Jokers and 19 blinds from Bunco. The new Jokers and edition are added to help with build variety, and some to give love to ranks, enhancements, and hands with little existing synergies. The new blinds are added to generally provide more variety, especially for Gold Stake's new effect.

## Changes
### Hands and Discards
- By default, you now start with 3 Hands and 4 discards, and earn $2 per remaining Hand at end of round (From BU's video)
   
### Jokers (reworks)
- Loyalty Card
  - Every 10th scoring card gains a random Enhancement, Edition, or Seal
  - (From BU's video)
 
- Splash
  - Played cards are always scored (this means that debuffed cards act as non-debuffed too)
  - (From FS's video)
 
- Flower Pot
  - +60 Chips for each card of a unique suit in scoring hand (so a max of +240 Chips)
  - "Each card of a unique suit" works like the original effect, so a single wild card *won't* activate the maximum effect.
  - (inspired from BU's video)
 
- Matador
  - On final hand of Boss Blind, played cards earn $3 when scored
 
- Bootstraps
  - Scoring Hearts and Diamonds cards give +1 Mult for every $5 you have
  - (inspired from FS's video)
  
### Jokers (balance tweaks)
- Joker costs $2 -> $1
  - Many 'cheap' and simpler Jokers have generally been buffed, so this change has been made to give the simple Joker a niche of selling the same as its buy cost.
- Greedy Joker, Lusty Joker, Wrathful Joker, and Gluttonous Joker give +3 -> +4 Mult on scoring cards (From BU's video)
- Zany Joker and Crazy Joker give +12 -> +16 Mult when activating

- Wily Joker and Devious Joker give +100 -> +120 Chips when activating
- Crafty Joker gives +80 -> +100 Chips when activating
  - (From BU's video) buffs given to specific Jokers depending on their required poker hand, as especially some of the Mult values were too low.

- Ceremonial Dagger is Uncommon -> Common (From FS's video)
- Ceremonial Dagger costs $6 -> $4 (From FS's video)
- 8 Ball is pink now

- Scholar gives +4 -> +5 Mult on scoring cards (inspired from FS's video)
- Supernova and Ride the Bus cost $5/$6 -> $4 (To accomodate the lower starting number of Hands)
- Superposition now creates a Fool card, and only needs a Straight and a *played* (though not necessarily scoring) Ace to activate (From FS's video)
  - The extra bit allows for great synergy with Four Fingers
- Square Joker starts at +0 -> +16 Chips
  - To accomodate the lower starting number of Hands
- Baron is Rare -> Uncommon (From FS's video)
- Erosion gives +4 Mult for each card below 52 -> 54 in full deck (From FS's video)
  - Encourages taking the Joker less speculatively as it provides value more early
- Mail-In Rebate gives $5 -> $3 per discarded card (From FS's video)
  - A harsher nerf to account for the higher starting number of Discards
- Fortune Teller costs $6 -> $4 (From FS's video)
